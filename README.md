#### Git Email Parser
This is a Ruby script that will find all the contributors to a git repository. And display the contributors name and email address sorted alphabetically. It will then rm -rf the cloned repo after you run the script.

In your terminal run the following:

` $ git clone https://github.com/Robbie-Smith/git_email_parser.git`

` $ cd git_email_parser`

`$ ruby script.rb  https://github.com/<USER-NAME>/<REPO-NAME>`
